<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    Hello! I’m a passionate web developer with extensive experience in building modern, responsive websites and applications. My expertise lies in HTML, CSS (including advanced concepts like SASS), JavaScript, Node.js, jQuery, Bootstrap, and leveraging Grid and Flexbox for flexible layouts. Over the years, I’ve worked on various front-end development projects that combine clean code with engaging user interfaces.
</p>
<p>
    I thrive on writing efficient and scalable code, ensuring that each project I take on is optimized for performance, accessibility, and mobile-first design. From crafting beautiful UIs to integrating powerful backend technologies, I’m always up for solving complex problems with simple, elegant solutions.
</p>
<p>
    Beyond web development, I have a deep interest in computer science, especially in game development, retro gaming, and console repair. I enjoy fixing and modding retro consoles, often restoring them to their former glory and reselling them to fellow enthusiasts. It’s a rewarding hobby that keeps me connected with gaming’s rich history.
</p>
<p>
    Whether it's designing cutting-edge websites or diving into the intricate details of retro gaming hardware, I love to stay immersed in technology. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or just chat about web development, gaming, or tech in general!
